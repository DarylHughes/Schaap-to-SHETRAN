# Schaap-To-SHETRAN

This project simply shares some code that:
- takes global soils data from 0.25° Hydraulic-Params Soil-Grids-Schaap (Montzka et al., 2017) NB this requires some GIS pre-processing, described in a future publication
- translates this into a format suitable for SHETRAN (Newcastle University, 2023)

This is useful for parameterising SHETRAN models in regions where sparse data is available regarding appropriate Maulem-van Genuchten hydraulic parameters.

Please contact me if you have any feedback
If you use the code for publications, please acknowledge this URL for the time being
